With so many todo apps available in the market, does it really make any difference to create another one?
But what if I tell you, with NoteIt you can create a room and all your friends can share a single room to keep your
notes and todos


## Download

Why wait? Download NoteIt from https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SgBHs7fojC3DK4r6dQxIR4c7tvIGN_bp/view?usp=sharing

Your mobile will show a number of security concerns while downloading NoteIt ... But trust me I am not knowledgable enough 
to build a virus...
